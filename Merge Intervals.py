'''
Merge Intervals: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping
intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
